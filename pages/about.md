Welcome to What The Font, your favourite blog for everything fonty!

This blog is for those fun font people, the Helvetica's among the typography community rather than the Times New Romans. Made entirely for the purpose of a university assignment, What The Font is the newest, coolest font blog out there. Check out our font of the month, or browse our other articles!

Our titular font is Cooper Black, a bold retro font that we feel really represents our audience. From those slightly older but still fun fontists, to our young and cool audience. This ones for you.
